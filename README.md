_For detail, check folder docs/RestaurantPOS_20_Autumn2021_

Point of sale (POS) or point of purchase is the time and place where a retail transaction is completed. At the point of sale, the merchant calculates the amount owed by the customer, indicates that amount, may prepare an invoice for the customer, and indicates the options for the customer to make payment. In restaurant business, POS systems often include table reservation, ordering food, alerts, billing, credit card processing and customer management. Even before the COVID-19 crisis, POS systems had gained traction across the industry. During the coronavirus pandemic, restaurants face greater peril than ever. Such systems are expected to increase business intelligence, reduce wasted effort and opportunity to scale to a large business. Moreover, the systems should support take-away options Our customers have multiple restaurants and have a need to develop a responsive web-based POS system that implement the current business flow as described in Figure 1. (The current POS terminal can be replaced in this web-based solution)

The restaurant owners express several special demands for the new system:
- The system should allow non-direct contact between Clerks and Customers
- The system should be implemented using Web technology and QR code, so
customers will not have to install apps
- The system should be usable from a mobile device, a tablet device or a normal
computer/ laptop
- The system should be extendable to use in multiple restaurants in the future
- The current transactions is about 300 orders per day.
